# Student Task Management System

'''This program was based from the Job Scheduler Program from the reference link below. This program implements a data structure particularly the Binary Search Tree.
Moreover, this program will allow the user to store student information (name, student number, course, address, phone number), add more student information, edit,
delete, view all the student information, search a student information, and lastly, manage task - where the user can view the task for today's schedule, add task, 
and remove task. I modified the original program (Job Scheduler) and turned it into a Student Task Management System since as a fellow student managing tasks
(school requirements) is important. This will help the user to create their own schedule in task management and avoid procastination.''' 

# Note: The original Job Scheduler Program allows the user to only view the jobs for today's schedule, add job, and remove job.
